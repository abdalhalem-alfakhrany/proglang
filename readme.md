# ProgLang: A Journey into Programming Language Development

ProgLang, a shorthand for programming language ( average C developer try to  name a variable ). While not intended for production use (at least for now), this project serves as a robust learning experience.

## Build and Experiment

The language is currently functional on my development machine running Linux (Arch), and I'm optimistic it will also function on Windows.

**Build:**
```
$ make proglang
```

**Try:**
```
$ ./build/proglang examples/main.prog
```
you can also see the ast of code by adding -ast_dump flag with type of dumping you prefer

this will give you a dot file you can render it with graphviz
```
$ ./build/proglang <filename>.prog -ast_dump graph
```

this will print to terminal directly
```
$ ./build/proglang <filename>.prog -ast_dump term
```

## Syntax Snapshot

Here's a sneak peek into ProgLang's syntax:

```c
inc (int a) {
    return a + 1;
}

dec (int a) {
    return a - 1;
}

main () {
    return inc(2);
}
```

This snippet provides a glimpse of the current state, with ongoing efforts to introduce new features. Naturally, it supports various binary operators (excluding ^).

It's important to note that numerous errors may surface during usage ‚Äì expect the unexpected!

I extend my gratitude to anyone willing to contribute. Experienced individuals, your insights and expertise would be immensely valuable in shaping the evolution of ProgLang. Let's collaborate and make this journey into programming language development even more enriching! ü§ù
